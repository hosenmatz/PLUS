based on Arduino Nano clone from PRC
based on OTTO firmware v9

the PCB is a single sided PCB to be milled by a cnc with only THD-parts

the serial connection is commented out because Bluetooth module is using the RX/TX Pins - means no controlling by wire

this way it is working with the OTTO DIY App now
